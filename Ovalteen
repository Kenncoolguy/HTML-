                    <p>To go fishing, You need a standard rod, Spinning reel is recommended.
                        Then Go buy bait or lure hooks, Or just attach bait to hooks. Tie knot on the 
                        reel to connect it. Go open the reel and connect the line and roll it until ideal length.
                        Place it and screw it onto the rod. Make sure it is on the bottom, Open the screw on the side of the reel to switch hands.
                    Most people prefer left side. some prefer right. Then, put 2 stoppers and go put a bobber on it. Tie
                    the hook to the knot or your lure hook, You can go fishing.

                    <p>After fishing experience, Try to learn a baitcaster, Baitcasters have 2 spinning parts
                        and are easier to cast, But it's downside is it tangles slightly more if cast too far or cast too fast.
                        It lives up to it's name, Casting bait. This makes it an ideal choice for intermediate users.
                        If not handled properly, may tangle very bad. Still same tying method to hook, Can lift more weight and can catch tuna if accompanied by 
                        another person with a long sickle.
